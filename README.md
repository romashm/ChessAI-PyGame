<h2> ‚ôüÔ∏è Main target </h2>
<p> It's to make an AI which can think how to do, that win & achieve lose of the opponent. This project, I was inspared playing games & I thought how to make bots which can exactly bit player -> don't make a superfluous action </p>
<h2> üõ†Ô∏è Development </h2>
<p> First of all, I create a <code>config.py</code> it's file need to write down several const. Therefore, I create a <code>main.py</code> where'll accure & call all functions. Inside main.py -> <b> class Main: </b> you can find a consructor which just render a screen. Likewise, you can find here <b> function mainloop ( ) </b> -> it is render game. Then I create a <code>GameEndine.py</code> -> which will describe <b> class Game: </b> -> function field ( )'ll create colorful pieces on the field.</p>
